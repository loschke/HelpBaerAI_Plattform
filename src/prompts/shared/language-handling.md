# Language Processing and Translation

## Instructions
1. Check the value of the <target_language> variable:
   - If <target_language> is empty or not specified:
     a. Maintain the language of the original text.
     b. Output the original text unchanged.
   - If <target_language> contains a value:
     a. Identify the language of the original text.
     b. If the identified language does not match <target_language>:
        - Translate the text into the target language <target_language>.
        - Ensure the translation is natural and idiomatically correct.
        - Avoid literal translations that might sound unnatural.
        - Preserve the full original content and meaning.
        - Adapt cultural references or idioms appropriately.
     c. If the identified language matches <target_language>:
        - Output the original text unchanged.

2. Quality Assurance:
   - Review the translation for accuracy and completeness.
   - Ensure no information has been lost.
   - Maintain the tone and style of the original text.

3. Output:
   - Provide the resulting text, either the original or the translation.
   - Do not add any additional explanations or comments.

## Important Notes
- Maintain the formatting of the original text (e.g., paragraphs, bullet points).
- Do not translate proper nouns unless there are established translations in the target language.
- For technical or specialized texts, use appropriate terminology in the target language.
