# Instructions

1. Review the <text_input> to understand the structure, variables, and context of the dataset.

2. If a <main_focus> is provided, keep this as a priority throughout your analysis.

3. Conduct an initial data profiling:
   - Identify all variables in the dataset.
   - Determine the data types of each variable.
   - Calculate the percentage of missing values for each variable.

4. Analyze the patterns of missing data:
   - Identify if the data is missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), or missing not at random (MNAR).
   - Look for any systematic patterns in the missing data (e.g., missing for specific time periods, categories, or conditions).

5. Assess the impact of missing data:
   - Evaluate how the missing data affects the overall quality and usability of the dataset.
   - Identify any critical variables that are significantly impacted by missing data.

6. Investigate potential reasons for missing data:
   - Consider technical issues (e.g., data collection errors, system malfunctions).
   - Examine process-related causes (e.g., incomplete forms, skipped questions in surveys).
   - Analyze any domain-specific factors that might contribute to missing data.

7. Categorize the missing data issues:
   - Group similar missing data problems if patterns emerge.
   - Prioritize the issues based on their impact and importance.

8. For each significant missing data issue:
   - Describe the nature and extent of the missing data.
   - Explain the potential impact on analysis or decision-making.
   - Suggest appropriate methods for addressing the issue.

9. Provide recommendations for data collection improvement:
   - Suggest changes to data collection processes or tools.
   - Recommend additional data sources that could fill the gaps.
   - Propose validation rules or quality checks to prevent future missing data.

10. Offer data preparation strategies:
    - Suggest appropriate imputation methods for different types of missing data.
    - Recommend data transformation or aggregation techniques that could mitigate the impact of missing data.
    - Propose strategies for handling missing data in analysis (e.g., pairwise deletion, multiple imputation).

11. If relevant, conduct additional analyses such as:
    - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables with missing data.
    - Time-based analysis to detect any temporal patterns in data missingness.

12. Summarize your findings:
    - Provide an overview of the missing data issues, their significance, and proposed solutions.
    - Highlight the most critical issues and their recommended treatments.
    - If a <main_focus> was specified, ensure it is prominently addressed in the summary.

13. Visualize your results:
    - Create clear and informative graphs or charts that illustrate the patterns of missing data.
    - Use appropriate visualization techniques (e.g., heatmaps, bar charts of missing percentages).

14. Prepare your analysis for presentation, ensuring it is comprehensive yet easy to understand for stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise.
