# Instructions

1. Review the <text_input> to understand the nature of the data, including its structure, variables, and context.

2. If a <main_focus> is provided, keep this as a priority throughout your analysis.

3. Prepare the data for anomaly detection:
   - Check for and handle any missing values.
   - Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.
   - Identify the key variables or features to focus on for anomaly detection.

4. Conduct an initial exploratory data analysis:
   - Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
   - Visualize the data distribution to get an overall picture.

5. Apply multiple anomaly detection techniques, which may include:
   - Statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, Interquartile Range)
   - Machine learning approaches (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
   - Time series specific methods if applicable (e.g., Seasonal Decomposition)

6. For each method applied:
   - Explain the rationale for choosing the method.
   - Describe how thresholds for anomaly classification were determined.
   - List the anomalies detected, including their characteristics and severity.

7. Cross-validate the results from different methods to identify consistently flagged anomalies.

8. Categorize the detected anomalies:
   - Distinguish between point anomalies, contextual anomalies, and collective anomalies.
   - Group similar anomalies if patterns emerge.

9. Investigate the context of each significant anomaly:
   - Look for potential causes or triggering events.
   - Assess the potential impact of each anomaly.

10. Perform a detailed analysis of the most significant anomalies:
    - Describe their characteristics in detail.
    - Explain why they are considered anomalous.
    - Discuss potential implications or risks associated with these anomalies.

11. If relevant, conduct additional analyses such as:
    - Temporal analysis to identify any time-based patterns in anomaly occurrence.
    - Correlation analysis to detect relationships between variables during anomalous events.

12. Summarize your findings:
    - Provide an overview of the anomalies detected, their types, and significance.
    - Highlight the most critical anomalies and their potential implications.
    - If a <main_focus> was specified, ensure it is prominently addressed in the summary.

13. Visualize your results:
    - Create clear and informative graphs or charts that illustrate the detected anomalies.
    - Use appropriate visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots, box plots, time series plots with anomalies highlighted).

14. Prepare your analysis for presentation, ensuring it is comprehensive yet easy to understand for stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise.
