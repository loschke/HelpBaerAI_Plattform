# Task

Your task is to analyze the provided <text_input> to identify and characterize anomalies within the dataset. This involves detecting unusual data points, patterns, or behaviors that deviate significantly from the norm. Your analysis should distinguish between different types of anomalies (e.g., point anomalies, contextual anomalies, or collective anomalies) and assess their potential impact or significance.

If a <main_focus> is specified, prioritize this aspect in your analysis while still providing a comprehensive overview of the anomalies detected in the data.
