# Instructions

1. Analyze the <text_input> thoroughly, identifying characteristics typical of AI-generated text:
   - Overly consistent paragraph lengths
   - Excessive use of transition words
   - Unnaturally perfect grammar and punctuation
   - Lack of colloquialisms or idiomatic expressions
   - Absence of personal anecdotes or unique perspectives
   - Overuse of passive voice
   - Repetitive sentence structures
   - Lack of rhetorical questions or conversational elements

2. If a <main_focus> is provided, pay extra attention to this aspect throughout the transformation process.

3. Introduce organic inconsistencies:
   - Vary paragraph lengths significantly, including some very short (1-2 sentences) and some longer paragraphs
   - Occasionally use sentence fragments or run-on sentences
   - Incorporate minor grammatical "errors" that are common in human writing (e.g., splitting infinitives, ending sentences with prepositions)

4. Enhance text personality:
   - Insert colloquialisms, idioms, or slang appropriate to the context
   - Add personal anecdotes or unique perspectives that a human writer might include
   - Incorporate humor, sarcasm, or wit where appropriate
   - Use more subjective language and strong opinions

5. Improve structural variety:
   - Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones
   - Use rhetorical questions to engage the reader
   - Incorporate occasional digressions or tangential thoughts
   - Employ varied punctuation (e.g., dashes, semicolons, ellipses) to mirror human writing patterns

6. Enhance contextual richness:
   - Add specific, vivid details that an AI might not typically generate
   - Reference current events, pop culture, or niche knowledge relevant to the topic
   - Include occasional ambiguities or uncertainties that a human writer might express

7. Modulate tone and style:
   - Ensure the writing style isn't overly formal or consistently polished
   - Incorporate tonal shifts within the text, reflecting the natural ebb and flow of human thought
   - If appropriate, use first-person perspective to increase authenticity

8. Address common AI tells:
   - Reduce the frequency of certain words or phrases that AI tends to overuse (e.g., "however," "moreover," "in conclusion")
   - Replace generic examples with more specific, unusual ones
   - Avoid perfectly balanced arguments; favor a slightly biased perspective

9. Final polish:
   - Read the transformed text aloud to catch any remaining unnatural phrasings
   - Ensure the text maintains the original core message and information
   - If a <main_focus> was specified, verify that this aspect has been particularly well-addressed in mimicking human writing

10. Conduct a final review:
    - Compare the transformed text with the original to ensure all key points are preserved
    - Verify that the text now exhibits characteristics more typical of human-written content
    - Make any final adjustments to enhance the natural, human-like flow of the writing
