# Instructions

1. Carefully analyze the provided <text_input> to understand the context and requirements for the sample data.

2. If a <main_focus> is provided, keep this as a priority throughout your data generation process.

3. Identify the key entities and attributes that should be included in the dataset based on the description.

4. Determine appropriate data types for each attribute (e.g., text, number, date, boolean).

5. Create a structure for the dataset, including field names that are clear and relevant to the context.

6. Generate a diverse set of sample records:
   - Aim for at least 10-20 records, unless the context suggests a different number is more appropriate.
   - Ensure variety in the data to represent different possible scenarios.
   - Include some common cases and some edge cases to make the dataset more comprehensive.

7. For each field, consider the following:
   - Text fields: Generate realistic and varied content, including different lengths and formats where appropriate.
   - Numeric fields: Provide a range of values, including whole numbers and decimals if relevant.
   - Date fields: Use realistic and varied dates, considering the context for appropriate ranges.
   - Boolean fields: Include both true and false values across the dataset.
   - Categorical fields: Ensure all relevant categories are represented, with a realistic distribution.

8. Maintain internal consistency within each record and across the dataset.

9. If the context involves relationships between entities, reflect these in the generated data.

10. Consider including:
    - Some null or empty values where it makes sense, to represent incomplete data scenarios.
    - Any domain-specific conventions or standards that would be expected in real data of this type.

11. Format the data in a clear and readable manner, using a structure that's appropriate for the type of data (e.g., table for structured data, JSON for nested data).

12. Provide a brief data dictionary or explanation of the fields, including any assumptions made about data types or value ranges.

13. If relevant, suggest potential uses or analyses that could be performed with this sample dataset.

14. Be prepared to explain your choices in data generation, especially for any aspects that required interpretation of the input description.
