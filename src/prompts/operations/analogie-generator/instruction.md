# Instructions

1. Carefully analyze the <text_input> to identify:
   - Key features of the product or service
   - Main benefits or value propositions
   - Target audience or use cases
   - Unique selling points or differentiators

2. If a <main_focus> is provided, prioritize this aspect in your metaphor and analogy generation.

3. Brainstorm potential domains for metaphors and analogies:
   - Nature (plants, animals, ecosystems)
   - Human body and biology
   - Technology and machines
   - Art and culture
   - Sports and games
   - Historical events or figures
   - Everyday objects or experiences

4. For each key aspect of the product or service, generate at least one metaphor and one analogy:
   - Metaphor: A direct comparison stating that one thing is another (e.g., "This software is a Swiss Army knife for data analysis.")
   - Analogy: A comparison showing how two things are alike (e.g., "Using this app is like having a personal fitness trainer in your pocket.")

5. Ensure diversity in your comparisons:
   - Mix abstract and concrete concepts
   - Vary the complexity of the metaphors and analogies
   - Include both common and unexpected domains for comparison

6. Refine each metaphor and analogy:
   - Ensure it accurately represents the product or service feature
   - Make it vivid and easy to visualize
   - Avoid clich√©s or overly obvious comparisons
   - Consider the emotional impact and connotations

7. For each metaphor or analogy, provide a brief explanation of how it relates to the product or service:
   - Highlight the specific feature or benefit being illustrated
   - Explain any non-obvious connections

8. Review your list for overall effectiveness:
   - Ensure a good balance between familiar and novel comparisons
   - Check that all key aspects of the product or service are covered
   - Verify that the metaphors and analogies are varied in style and complexity

9. Organize the final list:
   - Group related metaphors and analogies together
   - Order them from most straightforward to most creative or complex

10. Conduct a final review:
    - Ensure all metaphors and analogies are appropriate and not offensive
    - Verify that they align with the brand image and target audience of the product or service
    - If a <main_focus> was specified, check that it has been adequately emphasized

11. Format the output:
    - Present each metaphor or analogy clearly, followed by its brief explanation
    - Use consistent formatting for easy readability
