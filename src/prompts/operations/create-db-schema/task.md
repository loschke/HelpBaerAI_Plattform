# Task

Your task is to analyze the provided <text_input>, which will be in JSON, XML, or CSV format, and develop a comprehensive database schema based on the data structure and content. This involves identifying entities, relationships, attributes, and data types, as well as suggesting appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes. Your proposed schema should aim to optimize data integrity, minimize redundancy, and support efficient querying while considering the specific requirements and characteristics of the data.

If a <main_focus> is specified, prioritize this aspect in your schema design while still addressing the overall data structure and relationships.
