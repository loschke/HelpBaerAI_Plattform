# Instructions

1. Review the <text_input> to understand the nature of the time series data, including its structure, time frame, and variables.

2. If a <main_focus> is provided, keep this as a priority throughout your analysis.

3. Prepare the data for analysis:
   - Check for and handle any missing values or outliers.
   - Ensure the data is properly sorted by time.
   - If necessary, resample the data to a consistent time interval.

4. Conduct an initial exploratory data analysis:
   - Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
   - Visualize the entire time series to get an overall picture of the data.

5. Identify and analyze long-term trends:
   - Use techniques such as moving averages or trend line fitting to identify overall direction.
   - Quantify the strength and direction of any long-term trends.

6. Detect and examine seasonal patterns:
   - Look for recurring patterns at fixed intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
   - Quantify the strength and nature of any seasonal effects.

7. Identify any cyclical patterns:
   - Look for recurring patterns that are not tied to fixed time intervals.
   - Describe the length and amplitude of any cycles found.

8. Detect and analyze any anomalies or unusual events:
   - Identify any significant spikes, dips, or other deviations from the overall patterns.
   - Investigate possible causes for these anomalies.

9. If applicable, perform a decomposition of the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

10. If relevant, conduct additional analyses such as:
    - Autocorrelation analysis to identify any time-based dependencies.
    - Cross-correlation analysis if multiple variables are present.

11. Summarize your findings:
    - Describe the main trends, patterns, and anomalies discovered.
    - Provide possible interpretations of these findings.
    - If a <main_focus> was specified, ensure it is prominently addressed in the summary.

12. Visualize your results:
    - Create clear and informative graphs or charts that illustrate the key findings.
    - Ensure all visualizations are properly labeled and easy to interpret.

13. Prepare your analysis for presentation, ensuring it is comprehensive yet easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders.
